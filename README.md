How we are optimizing Nuxt without removing features in VueStorefront
Tech: VueStorefront, CompositionAPI, Nuxt, REST API, GraphQL

How we are optimizing Nuxt without removing features in VueStorefront

One of the implications of web shifting to mobile is the fact that we have to optimize our apps for mobile devices. With the overall complexity of our apps growing this task could be hard. We spend a lot of time figuring out how to make the new version of Vue Storefront that is based on Nuxt and Composition API as fast as possible. In this talk I want to share all, sometimes very hacky techniques we used to make Vue Storefront scoring great on Lighthouse (85-90+) despite significant complexity and inability to use static mode.

You will learn which modules we used to optimize our bundles, when to preconnect and prerender, how we're making use of `transpile` property to use treeshaking more effectively, how we saved around 100 kb by proxying our client-side GraphQL requests via REST API to Nuxt middleware and how we're making sure that our project bundles will not grow over time and responses will always be extremely fast by keeping our business logic on the server-side.

This talk is a deep dive into various hacks we used to keep our Nuxt app and that you can use in your apps to achieve great results with a relatively small amount of work.

Vuex? No, itâ€™s X(state)Vue for UI
Tech: UI Components, State Graphs, isLoading, State Machines

UI components are built on user flows or state graphs. To manage these states, we usually resolved to boolean variables system like isLoading.

But this proves to be buggy and hard to maintain as the codebase grows. Is there a better solution?

In my talk, we will explore how we can fully control our Vue app's states and develop a more adaptive UI system to users' behavior while keeping the codebase scalable with state machines.
